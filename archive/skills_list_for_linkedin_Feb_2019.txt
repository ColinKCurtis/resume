- NIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) - Biomedical Data Translator Project - Green Team

- Improved and maintained web APIs for biomedical data access (SaaS) across multiple data types

- Automated creation of APIs based on large data files using 'Jinja2' scripting for Python

- Accelerated data collection from APIs through use of concurrent I/O using 'asyncio' and 'concurrent' modules

- Contributed analysis of large, graph-type data sets for rapid hypothesis generation in bioinformatics

- Utilized Jupyter Notebooks, with Python3, to analyze data and visualize results in a modular, shareable format

- Delivered effective, detail-oriented communications to multi-disciplinary teams both local and remote

- Developed icees-client, now a pip module, to allow easy Python3 interfacing to ICEES clincal-data API

- Performance tested APIs for high-concurrency request loads using 'JMeter'/'BlazeMeter' and 'Locust'
 
- Worked remotely with a Computational Biologist, through Slack, to develop an algorithm for aggregating gene and tissue IDs and then finding ID co-occurrence patterns in that data (publication in planning stage)
