    \item This automation reduced costs of image analysis, for a single publication, from \$2500 dollars (50 hours at \$50 per hour) to 25 dollars (30 minutes at \$50 per hour)!

    \item Fitting of data using iterative categorization and regression

    \item Weighting and bias of fit automatically calculated according to uncertainty in measurement

    \item Classification of continuous fitting zones (linear v. exponential) by $Adjusted-R^2$ goodness of fit comparison

    \item In the context of my doctoral research, used to find: fractal dimension, saturation roughness, and correlation analysis from Atomic Force Microscope images

    \item Written in MATLAB, chosen as the correct tool for processing large matrices or linear algebra
