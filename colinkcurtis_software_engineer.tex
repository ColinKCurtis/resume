\CVItem{Adaptive Learning Analysis for Images (ALAI), A Machine Learning Application} 

\begin{compactitem}[\color{Blue}$\circ$]
   
    \SmallSep

    \item Reduced costs of image analysis by reducing the user's time-per-image by a factor of 100

    \item Data fitted using iterative categorization and regression

    \item Weighting and bias-of-fit automatically calculated according to uncertainties from measurements

    \item Classification of continuous fitting zones (linear v. exponential) by $Adjusted-R^2$ goodness of fit comparison

    \item The goal was to determine fractal dimension, saturation roughness, and correlation analysis from Atomic Force Microscope images

    \item Written in MATLAB, chosen for statistical processing large matrices and linear algebra efficiency
