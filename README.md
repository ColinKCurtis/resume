## <p> My focus is on Software Development, Data Engineering, and Machine Learning Applications.  
Spending time analyzing images from various microscopy instruments
at NCSU Physics piqued my interest in automating and improving the
process of gathering information from images. Specifically, I
developed a software application, Adaptive Learning Analysis for Images (ALAI),
to automate the calculation of surface roughness (texture) parameters 
for images of 'any' size. The mathematical principles underlying this work 
were developed by Dr. Jacqueline Krim, et al. MATLAB, well-suited to large-matrix
and statistical operations, was the language used to develop ALAI. </p>

<p>Currently, my strongest programming language is Python 3. My data engineering and software development experiences at 
Renaissance Computing Institute (RENCI) have given me the ability to produce 
robust, clean, and modular code for use in the bioinformatics space and beyond. 
The work at RENCI, a highly multi-disciplinary environment, has required me to
rapidly learn and adapt in order to deliver detail-oriented services and code 
to our Data Science teams.</p>
