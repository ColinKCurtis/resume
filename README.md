## My focus is on Computer Vision and, more broadly, Software Development.  
Spending time analyzing images from various microscopy instruments
## at NCSU Phyics piqued my interest in automating and improving the
## process of gathering information from images. More specifically, I have
## designed a software application, Adaptive Learning Analysis for Images (ALAI),
## to automate the calculation of surface roughness (texture) parameters 
## for images of 'any' size. This application was produced using MATLAB, however
## my strongest programming language is now Python 3.
