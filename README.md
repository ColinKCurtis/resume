## <p> My focus is on Computer Vision and, more broadly, Software Development.  
Spending time analyzing images from various microscopy instruments
at NCSU Physics piqued my interest in automating and improving the
process of gathering information from images. Specifically, I
developed a software application, Adaptive Learning Analysis for Images (ALAI),
to automate the calculation of surface roughness (texture) parameters 
for images of 'any' size. The mathematical principles underlying this work 
were developed by Dr. Jacqueline Krim, et al. ALAI was produced in MATLAB. </p>

<p>Currently, my strongest programming language is Python 3. My experiences at 
Rennaissance Computing Institute (RENCI) have given me the ability to produce 
robust, clean, and modular code for use in the bioinformatics space and beyond. 
A multi-disciplinary environment, my time at RENCI has required me to
quickly adapt in order to deliver our Data Science teams detail-oriented
services and code.</p>
