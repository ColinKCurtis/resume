## <p> My focus is on Computer Vision and Image Analysis through Deep Learning and Software.
Spending time analyzing images from various microscopy instruments
at NCSU Physics piqued my interest in automating and improving the
process of gathering information from images. Specifically, I
developed a software application, Adaptive Learning Analysis for Images (ALAI),
to automate the calculation of surface roughness (texture) parameters
for images of 'any' size. The mathematical principles underlying this work
were developed by Dr. Jacqueline Krim, et al. MATLAB, well-suited to large-matrix
and statistical operations, was the language used to develop ALAI. </p>

<p> Currently, my work is at EASi, a long-time software development group focused
on the automotive industry. My speciality remains image analysis, now through the
application of both prescriptive, mathematical methods and as well as statistical,
machine learning methods. Choosing the correct tool for the job is critical and
typically it is the size and quality of the data set which will dictate the
appropriate approach in developing a computer vision or image analysis solution.

<p> Previously, my data engineering and
software development experiences at Renaissance Computing Institute (RENCI) gave me the
ability to produce robust, clean, and modular code for use in the bioinformatics space and beyond.
The work at RENCI, a highly multi-disciplinary environment, has required me to
rapidly learn and adapt in order to deliver detail-oriented services and code
to our Data Science teams.</p>
